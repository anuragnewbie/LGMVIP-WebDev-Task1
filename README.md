This is the task 1 assignment of my web development internship at LetsGrowMore
in which I was instructed to build a single page website.

I have developed a nature related website just as a reason for spreading
awareness among people to protect our nature and steps they can take to do
the same.

I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap Framework.

Hope you will like it. ðŸ˜€
